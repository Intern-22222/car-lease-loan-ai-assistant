Intern A: AI-Based Negotiation Chatbot Frontend
Task 1: Chatbot Frontend

I created a chat interface where users can type messages.

Added placeholder responses to simulate chatbot replies.

Messages are displayed in a scrollable conversation view.

Styled messages differently for user and bot.

Task 2: File Upload Section

Added a file upload interface for users to upload contract documents (PDF/images).

Uploaded files are saved to a temporary folder (frontend simulation only).

UI shows contract summary placeholders like APR, payment, and term.

Task 3: History Section

Implemented session-based history display for uploaded files and chat messages.

Users can view their past conversation and uploaded contracts in the same interface.

Notes

Backend integration (POST /chat and /upload) is not implemented yet.

Frontend is ready for future API integration to handle real chatbot responses and file processing.

UI is responsive and works on desktop and mobile.

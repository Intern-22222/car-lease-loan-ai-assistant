# Project Requirements – Car Lease/Loan AI Assistant

## Purpose
Build an AI assistant that reviews car lease/loan agreements, extracts key fields, compares market prices, and assists with negotiation.

## Week 1 Scope
1. Collect 15 sample lease/loan contracts (PDF or public links).
2. File naming convention: samples/vendor-contractType-year-id.pdf
3. Create canonical SLA field dictionary (sla_fields.md).
4. Create JSON schema to represent extracted contract fields (schema.json).

## Folders
- /samples → 15 collected contracts
- /docs/sla_fields.md → list of standardized contract fields
- /docs/schema.json → JSON schema for parsed output
- /docs/requirements.md → this file

## Acceptance Criteria
- 10+ unique contract types
- 5+ different vendors

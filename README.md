  Poppler (Must be installed on OS and added to PATH)
2. Quick Start
Clone the repository
   git clone [https://github.com/Intern-22222/car-lease-loan-ai-assistant.git](https://github.com/Intern-22222/car-lease-loan-ai-assistant.git)
cd car-lease-loan-ai-assistant

Install Python dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt

📖 Usage
1. Run Manual Test (Week 1)
Convert all PDFs in the samples/ folder to text files in data/.
    python ocr/test_ocr.py
2. Run Automated Tests (Week 2)
 Verify the engine works on all sample files (checks for valid output > 100 chars).
     pytest -s tests/test_ocr.py
3. Using the Module in Code (Backend Integration)

   from backend.app.ocr import process_pdf
   # Simulate reading a file upload as bytes
   with open("samples/contract.pdf", "rb") as f:
      file_bytes = f.read()
   # Process the bytes directly
    clean_text = process_pdf(file_bytes)
    print(clean_text)

📋 Week 1 & 2 Deliverables (Intern C)

         Implements Regex cleaning.
         Handles exceptions gracefully.
    tests/test_ocr.py - Automated Pytest suite:
         Parametrized to test all PDFs in samples/.
         Validates output length and type.
    docs/OCR_Module.md - Technical documentation.<br>





* **🚀 Milestone 2**:

   Advanced Processing & Storage (Weeks 3 & 4)

Goal: Improve OCR accuracy on noisy documents and implement persistent data storage.

✨ Key Updates
1.  Noise Reduction (Computer Vision):
    * Integrated OpenCV to preprocess contract images before reading them.
    * Uses Adaptive Thresholding to remove shadows, coffee stains, and uneven lighting.
    * Converts images to high-contrast Grayscale/Binary for optimal Tesseract performance.

2.  Database Integration:
    * Added SQLAlchemy to connect the Python backend to a database.
    * Automatically saves every scanned filename and its extracted text to a local SQLite database (ocr_data.db).
    * Ensures parsed contracts are stored permanently for retrieval.

3.  Layout Handling:
    * Configured Tesseract with Page Segmentation Modes (PSM).
    * Optimized for uniform text blocks (Contracts) to prevent column misalignment.

 🛠️ How to Test Milestone 2

## 🧪 verification Tools (Milestone 2)

To ensure the Computer Vision (OpenCV) module is actually improving OCR quality, we created two specific test scripts.

1. Visual Debugging Test (visual_test.py)
Purpose: Generates "Before" vs. "After" images to visually verify that shadows, noise, and colors are being removed correctly.

How to Run:
    
    python visual_test.py

 2. Accuracy Comparison Test (accuracy_test.py)
Purpose:Quantifies the improvement by comparing the character count of OCR on the raw image vs. the cleaned image.

How to Run:
    
    python accuracy_test.py

3. Run the Full Pipeline
This runs the OCR on sample files and saves the results to the database.

    python -m pytest -s tests/test_ocr.py

4.Verify Database Storage
Run this script to peek inside the ocr_data.db file and confirm the text was saved.

     python check_db.py

✅ Milestone 2 Checklist
1.Install OpenCV & SQLAlchemy (pip install opencv-python-headless sqlalchemy)
2. Create preprocessing.py for image noise reduction
3. Create database.py for SQLite connection
4. Integrate Preprocessing & DB logic into ocr.py
5. Verify data persistence with check_db.py

## 🚀 Milestone 3 – Contract Comparison Dashboard & Insights View

### Overview
Milestone 3 focuses on building the **user interface layer** for comparing multiple car lease/loan contracts and providing actionable insights. This milestone implements a **contract comparison dashboard** and an **insights view** that allow users to upload multiple lease contract PDFs, extract key SLA parameters, and compare them side-by-side.

The goal is to improve transparency, simplify decision-making, and support negotiation readiness for users.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Multi-PDF Upload
- Users can upload **two or more lease contract PDFs** simultaneously.
- Supported format: `.pdf`

#### 2. Automatic SLA Extraction
From each uploaded contract, the system extracts the following fields:
- Interest Rate / APR  
- Lease Term Duration  
- Monthly Payment  
- Down Payment  
- Residual Value  
- Mileage Allowance & Overage Charges  
- Early Termination Clause  
- Purchase Option (Buyout Price)  
- Maintenance Responsibilities  
- Warranty and Insurance Coverage  
- Penalties or Late Fee Clauses  

> Extraction is currently regex-based for prototyping and will be replaced by LLM-based extraction in the next milestone.


### 3. Contract Comparison Dashboard
- Displays **side-by-side comparison** of all uploaded contracts.
- Each contract is shown as a column and each SLA parameter as a row.
- Enables quick visual comparison similar to e-commerce product comparison platforms.


### 4. Insights View
For each contract, the system provides:
- **Key metrics** (APR, Monthly Payment, Down Payment, Mileage, etc.)
- **Red flags detection**, such as:
  - Missing APR
  - Unclear maintenance responsibility
  - Strict early termination clauses
  - High penalties or late fees
- Highlights potential risks and unclear clauses to support better decision-making.


### Technical Implementation

- **Frontend/UI:** Streamlit  
- **PDF Processing:** pdfplumber  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas DataFrames  
- **Extraction Layer:** Regex-based (LLM-ready architecture)  

---

### How to Run (Milestone 3 UI)

1. Install dependencies:
     pip install streamlit pandas pdfplumber

Run the application:
     streamlit run streamlit_app.py

✅Deliverables for Milestone 3:
1.Working contract comparison dashboard
2.Insights view with red flags and highlights
3.Multi-PDF upload support
4.Real-time extraction and rendering of SLA parameters
